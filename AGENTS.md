# AGENTS.md — Rules for A-organizi
This file extends [A-workspace](./workspace/AGENTS.md).

This file extends root A-core AGENTS.md for the A-organizi plugin.

## Relationship to A-core

**A-organizi depends on A-core** for:
- `A` package imports (i18n, output, subprocess, SQLite)
- Plugin discovery via entry points
- Shared utilities
- **API Reference**: See [A-core AGENTS.md](https://github.com/Ron-RONZZ-org/A-core/blob/main/AGENTS.md#api-reference)

**All source code must import from `A`, never duplicate utilities.**

## Combined Plugin

A-organizi combines three autish commands:
- kalendaro (calendar)
- todo (tasks)
- taglibro (journal)

This is intentional — they share the same SQLite database for simplicity.

## If You Need Something in Core

If you need a utility that should be in A-core:

1. **Search existing issues** on [A-core](https://github.com/Ron-RONZZ-org/A-core/issues)
2. **Create an issue** describing the need
3. **Wait for core enhancement** before implementing locally
4. **Use feature detection** when available

## Architecture

```
src/A_organizi/
├── __init__.py       # Plugin exports
├── cli.py           # Typer app with subcommands
├── service.py     # Business logic
└── data/
    └── storage.py # SQLite (uses A.data.base)
```

## Code Standards

1. Use `tr()` for all user-facing strings
2. Use `error()` for errors, `info()` for info
3. Type hints on all public functions
4. Docstrings on all public functions
5. Tests required for all modules
6. Use WAL mode for SQLite

## What to Avoid

- Don't duplicate A-core utilities
- Don't skip i18n (use `tr()`)
- Don't use `print()` — use `A` output functions
- Don't hardcode paths — use `A.core.paths`
- Don't implement utilities that should be in core
